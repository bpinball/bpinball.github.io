		<h1>Robotron Source Code</h1>
		<p>
			The files below can be used to rebuild my Robotron game (excluding the info page).
			You will need the assembler from the SDCC Z80 cross-compiler and the zmakebas BASIC text
			to tap ZX Spectrum tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			The assembly code was reverse engineered from a disassembly of the game TAP file as published
			by "Krypton Force" back in 1985. I still have no idea how a copy of my game that I gave to
			my next door neighbour back in 1983 came to be published, without my knowledge until 2023, 
			by Krypton Force. But thanks anyway Krypton Force for preserving my game!
